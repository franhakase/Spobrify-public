### Description

**Spobrify** is a C# application to listen(audio only) to `Youtube.com` videos. It supports most Youtube videos and is capable of loading and saving playlists for your convenience.
It works by parsing the Youtube web page content and extracting the audio stream, which saves bandwitdth and allows quick content loading. In order to use it, you will need **.NET Framework 4.7.2** or newer and **Windows Media Player** installed. It also relies on **Jurassic** for javascript parsing.
